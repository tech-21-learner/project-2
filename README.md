# Project-2
In file main.cpp, I have a class named myInt, which checks if a number have divisiblity of seven, if sum of digits is even or odd, if number is prime.
Also, we are generating a user defined array having positive numbers. We sort those numbers in the ascending order by calling function selectionSort. Then we search for index of a number by calling binarySearch function.
Even, we search for specific number's index in the array by using function linearSearch. 
While searching we are also checking if number exits in the array or not.
